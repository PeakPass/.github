PeakPass is a password manager and breach detector built in Python with the Flask framework. PeakPass uses a database of over 14 million previously breached passwords to let you know if one of your passwords is at risk. Along with this, we offer a small blog to teach users about online security standards.

PeakPass was made in ~1 month and recieved 2nd place in the Congressional App Challenge. This code has been published purely for transparency and to serve as reference for others to use.
